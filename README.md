# Weight-Based-Dosing-Calculator

### What Does the Calculator Do?
This text based program utilizes assembly programming to calculate the dosing of medications that are based on weight. In pharmacy it is very common to dose medications based on weight and on the pharmacist side, we have to deligently check these doses to make sure that the patient will no overdose or underdose so there is no fluctuation in laboratory values.

### Why These Drugs?
There are also drugs that contain what we call having a "Narrow Therapeutic Index". This means that small fluctuations in doses can have severe results for the patient, and therefore vital to dose correctly. The following program contains medications commonly used in my current place of work as well as some narrow therapeutic index drugs that pharmacists can utilize in their day to day to enhance patient safety.

### What Do the Numbers Mean?
This Weight-Based-Calculator utilizes MASM x 86 Assembler to create a text-based program where the user is able to quickly input the weight in kg. The results displayed will show the correct dosage and frequency of the medication. 

### How Do I Read the Values?
Note that the values are shown in exponent form. This means that the decimal spot must be appropriately moved to obtain the correct dose. 

Example 1: +3.5999998E-001 mg - Here the minus sign indicates moving decimal place one space to the left which gives 0.36 mg.

Example 2: +1.3500000E+002 mg - Here the minus sign indicates moving decimal place two spaces to the right which gives 135 mg.

The program also allows the user to loop as many times as necessary and prompts if they would like to continue.
